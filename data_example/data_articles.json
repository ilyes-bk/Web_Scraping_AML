A tourist component made up of six very high standard hotels, a nine-hole golf course, over 53 hectares, designed by the architect Peter Harradine, in partnership with The Professional Gulf Association (P.G.A.) – United Kingdom, as well as a Central Park of 20 ha which will offer walking fitness trails and entertainment and leisure areas. A residential area of ​​international standing, opening onto the northern banks of Lake Tunis, the golf course, and the Central Parc. A Shopping, Retail and Leisure component, with an international-scale mall, located on 13 hectares, and a multitude of landscaped green spaces judiciously distributed throughout the project. A Business Zone component, with a business district, meeting the latest international standards of very high standard. An entertainment component, with a 3 km cornice on the edge of the North Lake, accessible to the general public, with its terraces and its entertainment and leisure components. The wind has blown...

Today, the situation has worsened and our food security is becoming threatened. Indeed, at a time when the Russian army is deploying in Ukraine, the prospects of a drop in cereal production raise fears of a surge in prices, while our country imports most of its wheat from these two countries today. 'at war today. How we got to this situation In Tunisia, local production is either discouraged or regulated for the benefit of a few operators. At the same time, private companies in each sector regulate their industries, allowing them to keep competitors at bay. For example, wheat producers are forced to sell their production to a public monopoly at a discount of up to 25% compared to international prices, while flour mills and pasta producers are subsidized at different stages of production by the state. The result is that the income of small farmers has decreased and Tunisia is increasingly resorting to food imports as local production is declining from one year to the next. However, as soon as it began, the Russian-Ukrainian conflict caused a dizzying rise in the price of wheat. On Euronext, the price of a tonne of milling wheat has soared. Benchmark soft red winter wheat futures topped the daily limit, climbing 7.6% to $10.59 per bushel (about 27 kg). Corn rose 2.8% to reach its highest level since 2011 at $5.9 per bushel. The State must give way to young entrepreneurs Agriculture can help create jobs in the country and contribute significantly to economic recovery but the State should disengage and give way to young entrepreneurs, especially at the level of large farms to encourage large-scale production. Today, much of the state's land lies fallow in the northern and central regions, but most of this agricultural land is in the hands of cooperatives. At the same time, the State should focus on essential public services (example: getting the Cereals Office to ensure a competitive market, maintaining a safety stock, providing technical support to market players) and ensuring market regulation. .

Tunisia is trapped by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and we can only blame the Tunisian state for its poor management of the economic crisis which has lasted for ten years. The IMF finalized, on Tuesday February 22, 2022, a one-week virtual visit to Tunisia, where it met all the actors and officials concerned by the negotiations with Tunisia. If the results have not been revealed, certain indiscretions make us fear the worst. Tunisia no longer benefits from any room for maneuver and we are starting to talk about instructions, even diktats, that our country must implement. If, currently, the political context is causing concern, the economic and financial emergency is no less worrying. To understand the crisis, it is enough to recall that the State has drawn up its budget for the current year on the basis of the hypothesis of concluding an agreement with the IMF before the end of March, a first in the history of the country as confirmed by economists. The risk of payment default Otherwise, Tunisia will default and request a rescheduling of its debts; in this case, a passage through the Paris Club appears inevitable. A hard blow for an economy which was already struggling to absorb its significant budgetary and external imbalances. But we’re not there yet! Tunisia must, according to the IMF, commit to taking care of its wage bill, reduce expenses linked to subsidies for basic products and revive highly budget-intensive public companies. These are the three axes that the two parties are currently discussing, but the situation is perilous for Tunisia to the extent that painful measures and reforms appear to be essential. A glimmer of hope. The Central Trade Union said for the first time that it was open to fair and equitable reforms, which could help resolve the crisis. Indeed, at the end of his interview with the head of government, the first head of the Tunisian General Labor Union (UGG) Noureddine Taboubi announced that his organization will study all files relating to the social and economic situation in the country, adding that the trade union center is open to reforms which according to him, “must be fair and equitable for all social categories”. An essential agreement In any case, the agreement with the IMF is essential for Tunisia. This is what the Minister of Finance keeps repeating to warn against a clear deterioration in the financial situation and to underline the obligation to maintain the necessary reforms. “An agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is essential to ensure the State’s budgetary balances,” she suggested. Suffice to say that this financial institution has not stopped repeating it. Tunisia must review its strategy in terms of payroll, employment and subsidies.

Nourediine Taboubi was also indignant at the attempt of certain parties which seek to exploit the economic and social situation of the country with the aim of further aggravating the situation. Call for dialogue He estimated that Tunisia is no longer able to bear this situation and that each party must come together in order to save Tunisia, calling on all political parties to sit down at the dialogue table to find a solution. Tunisian-Tunisian solution. In Médenine, where he chaired, this Saturday, January 29, 2022, the 18th regional congress of the UGTT, Nourddine Taboubi was indignant at the fact that civil servants have still not received their salaries to date and insisted on the fact that \"the transfer of the public sector remains a red line and that he will oppose all attempts aimed at transferring public companies to the private sector\", declaring in particular that \"Tunisia is not for sale\". The public sector, a \"red line\" Yesterday, Friday January 28, Noureddine Taboubi made it known, during the work of the 26th congress of the Gafsa Regional Labor Union, that it is now necessary to save and protect the Company des Phosphates de Gafsa (CPG), and that it cannot be the only provider of jobs. Concerning the general situation in the country, he indicated that \"President Kaïs Saïed is responsible for his choices and his policy and that the UGTT is in no way responsible for the country's economic choices, inflation, the outbreak prices and the deterioration of the purchasing power of the citizen, but that it will not renounce the economic and social rights of its members\". He also recalled \"that no national or international party can delimit the scope of action of the trade union center\" and that the UGTT will have its say. The shadow of Kais Saied?! If the position of the UGTT does not change in relation to its defense of public structures, it seems that Noureddine Taboubi has \"propelled himself\" as a mediator. It should be remembered that on January 15 and after five months of breakup, he was finally able to have a one-on-one meeting with the President of the Republic, Kais Saied. A long meeting to clear up the vagueness that marked the last period in relations between the UGTT and the Palace of Carthage. If the UGTT went so far as to question the entire process of July 25 and rejected the individualistic approach of Kais Saied, in the past, in recent days, Taboubi has added water to his wine. Citing the events of July 25, the UGTT recalled last week that it supported the July 25 process from the start, which promised change and a break with the system of corruption and terrorism. But, she regretted the delay and hesitation of this process. “July 25 constitutes a historic opportunity to save the country, it must be transformed into a participatory process capable of rebuilding Tunisia,” it was communicated on January 21. The meeting on January 15 probably constitutes a pact between the two men. It intervenes out of obligation under the effect of the pressures of the economic crisis. Opening of dialogue? On the one hand, Carthage has no interest in entering into conflict with the UGTT whose role in the adoption of painful social measures remains crucial. And on the other hand, the Central Trade Union does not want to enter into confrontation with the President of the Republic who enjoys great popularity. Is this then a pact of obligation? For some, yes, if Tunisia wants to carry out its reforms, Carthage and the UGTT, the two most influential powers currently on the national scene, must indeed make a pact to save the national economy. More recently, the two men spoke by telephone, Wednesday January 26, 2022. A telephone call made on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of January 26, 1978, and during which Kais Saied expressed his “appreciation of the Union, of martyrs and the trade union movement.

In a statement to the Tunis Africa News Agency, Tariq Al-Saeedi defined excessive thinking or “intellectual rumination” as being stuck with a specific idea, which is repeated in an obsessive and repetitive manner and cannot be stopped, becoming an intellectual and psychological state that is out of control and requires a lot of energy and effort to stop and revolves around an idea or group of ideas. Women are more susceptible than men to excessive thinking, and international scientific studies have proven, according to the psychologist, that women are twice as susceptible to excessive thinking than men, which is one of the reasons they suffer from depression, warning that it leads to psychological disorders and its symptoms remain accompanying it even when suffering from one of the disorders. . Overthinking creates unfounded problems and invents arbitrary explanations that can lead to addiction to substances, smoking, alcohol, eating disorders, depression, and anxiety. The personalities most prone to overthinking are characterized by dependency as a first type (a personality that depends on others to make decisions, which makes them more vulnerable to frustration) and constant fear as a second type. Reasons for excessive thinking The reasons for excessive thinking, according to the psychologist, are the rapid technological development and social changes that have made the individual lose the ability to build solid and fixed standards, causing the individual to suffer from psychological fragility that makes it difficult for him to accept life’s difficulties, in addition to other reasons related to the absence of values. Al-Saeedi called for resisting false ideas and fighting them by filling free time, carrying out sports and cultural activities, expelling ideas, avoiding their escalation, and consciously evaluating social relations.", "art_category": "politics", "inactive": false, "country_code": "TN", "scrapped_by": "nessma-ar.bot", "art_source": "https://www.nessma.tv/ar", "art_creation_date": "2024-05-12 14:56:31.874864"}, {"art_url": "https://www.nessma.tv/ar/%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9/actu/%D9%88%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%82-%D9%84%D9%83%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AE%D9%86%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AD%D8%A9/504839", "art_title": "وفاة أول متلقٍ لكلية خنزير بعد شهرين من الجراحة", "art_published_at": null, "art_content": "The first recipient of a gene-edited pig kidney died two months after surgery, and the hospital said there was no indication that the death occurred as a result of the new organ transplant. Solomon was the first living person to receive a pig kidney. Richard (Rick) Solomon received a pig kidney at Massachusetts General Hospital last March. He was 62 years old. Surgeons believed that the new kidney he received could continue to work for at least two years, but On Saturday, his family and the hospital where he underwent the transplant received confirmation of his death. It is noteworthy that a pig kidney was previously transplanted into a brain-dead patient as an experiment. Two other patients, according to The Guardian, underwent a pig heart transplant, but they also died several months later. Suleiman had previously undergone a kidney transplant in 2018, but he returned to dialysis after tests showed signs of failure of the new kidney. After his health condition worsened, doctors advised him to transplant a kidney from a genetically modified pig. Suleiman's family expressed their thanks to the doctors for their efforts, saying that the process of transplanting an organ from an animal gave Rick's family an additional 7 weeks with him, and that his memory will remain in their hearts. In April, a New Jersey woman named Lisa Pisano received a genetically engineered pig kidney, as well as a pump to keep her heart working. The term \"ex vivo organ transfer\" refers to the treatment of an infected human by using cells, tissue or organ from an animal. Many attempts in this direction have previously failed because the human immune system rejects and destroys the new organ from the animal, but recent experiments focus on modifying pig organs to resemble human organs.", "art_category": "politics", "inactive": false, "country_code": "TN", "scrapped_by": "nessma-ar.bot", "art_source": "https://www.nessma.tv/ar", "art_creation_date": "2024-05-12 14:56:33.085876"}, {"art_url": "https://www.nessma.tv/ar/%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9/actu/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B6%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84/504849", "art_title": "البحرين تستضيف القمة العربية الخميس المقبل", "art_published_at": null, "art_content": "On Thursday, the 16th of May, the Kingdom of Bahrain is preparing to host the summit-level meeting of the Arab League Council in its 33rd regular session, for the first time in the history of regular and emergency Arab summits.

Sonia Dahmani is not making her first declaration hostile to the leaden screed that fell on Tunisia and everyone knew that her freedom of tone and her courage put her in imminent and certain danger. It was not his alleged antipatriotism that created problems for him, but his boldness, his love of freedom and the bad faith of his detractors.

A camp of horror and barbarism which in reality is more akin to a concentration camp than a prison. (Ph. CNN). Imed Bahri “At a military base that now serves as a detention center in Israel's Negev desert, an Israeli working at the facility took two photos of a scene that he says continues to haunt him. Rows of men in gray tracksuits are seen sitting on paper-thin mattresses, surrounded by barbed wire. All appear to be blindfolded, their heads bent heavily under the glow of the spotlights,” explains the investigation by the American channel. “A putrid smell filled the air and the room hummed with the murmurs of men,” the Israeli told CNN. who was in the establishment. Forbidden to speak to each other, the detainees muttered among themselves. “We were told they weren’t allowed to move. They should sit up straight. They are not allowed to speak. Not allowed to look under their blindfolds. The guards were instructed to shout ‘Oskot’ – shut up in Arabic – and to spot problematic people and punish them,” the source added. CNN spoke to three Israeli whistleblowers who worked in the Sde Teiman desert camp where Palestinians captured during Israel's invasion of Gaza are being held. All spoke out at the risk of legal repercussions and reprisals from groups supporting Israel's harsh policies in Gaza. They paint a portrait of a facility where doctors sometimes amputated prisoners' limbs due to injuries caused by constant handcuffs, medical procedures sometimes performed by underqualified doctors, earning Sde Teiman the reputation of being \" a paradise for interns” and where the air is filled with the smell of neglected wounds left to rot. According to accounts, the facility located about 30 kilometers from the Gaza border is divided into two parts: pens where around 70 Palestinian detainees from Gaza are placed under extreme physical restraint and a field hospital where injured detainees are strapped to their bed, wearing diapers and being fed with straws. “They stripped them of anything that looked like human beings,” said one whistleblower, who worked as a doctor at the facility’s field hospital. “The beatings were not intended to gather intelligence. They were executed out of revenge,” said another whistleblower. “It was punishment for what they (the Palestinians, editor’s note) did on October 7 and punishment for their behavior in the camp.” Responding to CNN's request for comment on all allegations made in this report, the Israeli military said in a statement: “The IDF ensures good conduct towards detainees in custody. Any allegations of misconduct by IDF soldiers are investigated and dealt with accordingly. In appropriate cases, investigations by the MPCID (Criminal Investigation Division of the Military Police) are opened when there is suspicion of misconduct justifying such action.\" And added: \"Detainees are handcuffed according to their level of risk and their state of health. The authorities are not aware of incidents of illegal handcuffing.”A mixture of rhetoric, lies and manipulation of which only Israeli propaganda is capable! CNN adds that the Israeli military has not directly denied reports that people were stripped naked or detained in diapers. Instead, she said the clothes will be returned to detainees once the IDF determines they pose no security risk. Reports of abuses at Sde Teiman have already surfaced in Israeli and Arab media after outcry from Israeli and Palestinian rights groups over conditions there. But this rare testimony from Israelis working at the facility sheds further light on Israel's conduct in its war in Gaza with new allegations of mistreatment. It also casts further doubt on the Israeli government's repeated claims that it is acting in accordance with accepted international practice and law. CNN requested permission from the Israeli army to access the Sde Teiman base. Last month, a CNN crew covered a small protest outside the main entrance by Israeli activists demanding the closure of the facility. Israeli security forces interrogated the team for about 30 minutes demanding to see the footage taken by the CNN photojournalist. Israel often subjects journalists, even foreign ones, to military censorship on security issues. The Israeli military has admitted to partially converting three different military installations into detention camps for Palestinian detainees from Gaza since Operation Al-Aqsa Flood which took place on October 7, 2023. These detention locations are Sde Teiman in the Negev desert as well as the military bases of Anatot and Ofer (nicknamed the Israeli Guantanamo) in the occupied West Bank. CNN interviewed more than a dozen former Gaza detainees who appeared to have been released from those camps. They said they could not determine where they were being held because they were blindfolded for most of their detention and cut off from the outside world. But the details of their stories match those of the whistleblowers. It is important to remember that this Sde Teiman camp in the Negev desert, which remained a secret prison until very recently and which was the subject of this CNN investigation, should not be confused with the Negev prison. which is another place of Israeli barbarity for decades but which is not a secret prison and which we have already spoken about in a previous article entitled “Torture in Israel reaches the stage of rape, testifies a former Palestinian detainee” .

Mohamed Chérif Ferjani* Everywhere, in the North, as in the South and the East, migrants are the target of racist hate campaigns accusing them of being at the origin of all the ills of society: violence, theft, trafficking of all kinds, prostitution, insecurity, etc. Proponents of the xenophobic theory of the “Great Replacement” see them as instruments of a plot aimed at overwhelming the societies of the countries through which migrants pass, or seek to settle there, in order to change their identity, culture and the social and political order. We persist in refusing to see the reasons why they tore themselves from their country, and theirs, to risk their lives crossing hostile deserts, the sea on makeshift boats, borders and countries where they are exposed to all forms of humiliation and persecution, by handing over their fate to unscrupulous traffickers who take their savings and hand them over to other traffickers who are even more greedy and less concerned about their fate. Those who persecute and hunt them are recruited from among the victims of the same neoliberal order imposing everywhere aggressive policies destroying systems of traditional solidarity and solidarities based on economic, social, political and cultural rights wrested by the struggles of several generations for centuries. decades, even centuries. Very few people realize the disasters that force them to leave their homes: natural calamities aggravated by the destruction of natural ecosystems and the environment, ethnic, tribal, confessional conflicts, wars between countries on which the same neoliberal system has imposed policies of “structural readjustment”, “true prices”, “free movement of capital and goods”, aggravating inequalities within all societies and between countries, for the benefit of a minority of wealthy people monopolizing the essential of the planet's wealth. According to the report of the inequality observatory published on September 18, 2020, the share of world heritage owned by the richest 1% increased from 41.7% in 2008 to 45% in 2019. Migrants from countries in the South and of the East, like the unemployed, the homeless and the homeless in the countries of the North and all over the world, are the victims of this system based on the implacable and merciless laws of a market economy aimed at achieving the greatest profits, in the shortest possible time, at the lowest costs and to the detriment of the overwhelming and crushed majority of humans reduced to the status of optional auxiliaries of this system. By leaving the countries of the South and the East to join the countries where, through unequal exchange based on the free movement of capital and goods, migrants are only following the movement of plundered wealth. of their countries. They reproduce what humans have done throughout time: leave places where they can no longer live as before – due to natural disasters, wars or policies like those imposed by colonization yesterday and imposed today. neoliberalism – to go where they hope to live better: What could be more legitimate? In the name of what morality would we want to forbid them? Is this not a fundamental right underlying the freedom of movement of which we want to deprive humans by reserving it for capital, goods, nationals of wealthy countries and granting it only to those whose skills are necessary for the growth of the dominant economic order? By asking countries in the South and East – like Rwanda, Tunisia, Egypt, Turkey, Romania, etc. – to play the role of border guard of Italy and Europe, and by blowing on the embers of xenophobia on which the different expressions of the conservative revolution in the North, as in the South and the East, surf, the neoliberal system adopted by the great powers and imposed on all countries, seeks to pit its victims against each other to perpetuate its reign. He thus wants to prevent them from uniting against him. By succumbing to the sirens of xenophobia, by engaging in the pursuit and persecution of migrants, as we see in certain countries subject to the same policies pushing their young people and their active forces into exile, and by attacking activists and to human rights organizations which denounce the fate reserved for undesirable foreigners, we become the auxiliaries of neoliberal policies whose victims are not only the migrants accused of all the misfortunes of the societies subjected to these policies. The victims of the neoliberal system, from the North, the South, the East or the West, have no interest in opposing each other by allowing themselves to be manipulated by the masters of this system aided by xenophobic ideologies. different expressions of the conservative revolution.

A disguised form to pull the rug out from under the feet of Palestinian day laborers. We must dislodge them on an empty stomach, this is the new common motto. Mohsen Redissi Times are getting bad, the specter of war in Gaza hangs over the kingdom, an ominous sign. Uprisings are increasing denouncing the Rabat-Tel Aviv rapprochement. Israel, for fear of reprisals, closed its diplomatic mission and recommended its citizens avoid traveling to Morocco. Prime Minister Netanyahu's planned visit to the kingdom this year was postponed but not canceled. Several activists are behind bars, their crime is to have expressed reservations about the correctness of the judgment of their Lord by affixing his seal on the Abraham Accords, signed in Rabat in December 2020. This is the trivialization of relations between the Morocco and Israel under the attentive and vigilant eye of the United States. Morocco is the fourth. These agreements have deeply widened the gap between the countries of the region. Any rapprochement with the sworn enemy is a betrayal. The Tunisia-Algeria-Libya tripartite meeting on April 22 in Tunis is obvious. In a kingdom where the monarch's choices are a requirement, social networks are closely monitored. Severe verdicts fall against those who dare to criticize normalization with the enemy. Activist Abdul Rahman Zankad receives five years in prison; a sentence considered serious when a wave of protests shook the country. The silence of the authorities is worrying. Moroccan drug traffickers have stopped supplying Israeli dealers with cannabis. It’s amazing, the dealers yes, the roilaa. The King of Morocco receives Western Sahara as a secret annex to his signing of these agreements. Give and take. A great reward which will change the appearance of the kingdom and its history. A territory rich in phosphate, disputed since the withdrawal of Spain between the Polisario Front which wants to establish its Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, Rasd, Mauritania, Algeria and Morocco. Three years later, July 2023, Israel officially recognizes Morocco's sovereignty over Western Sahara. Tel Aviv is in no hurry, Rabat is. To further exacerbate tensions between the Maghreb countries, the United States and Israel each intend to establish a consulate in the city of Dakhla, a city located in Western Sahara. Non-autonomous territory according to the UN. The State Department considers the opening of a consulate in Dakhla as a strengthening of bilateral cooperation in the service of the African continent. It has just allocated an envelope of 1.5 million dollars to finance development projects to the tune of 200,000 to 500,000 dollars for each project in two localities located in Western Sahara, Laâyoune and Dakhla. The initiative makes people jealous. France invites itself, touched in its heart. Morocco is a former colony and a stronghold that it cannot abandon so easily. Paris is willing to support Rabat in its efforts to develop the Sahara. We plan to finance the high voltage line between Dakhla and Casablanca. The Polisario firmly condemns France's good intentions. By coming to the aid of King M6, she blessed the annexation and tolerated the violation of international law. Morocco has become a minefield. Israel seems to have set its sights on it. Barely a year after signing the agreements, Rabat and Tel Aviv signed a framework security cooperation agreement and launched joint projects under the watchful eye of Algiers. Kasbah denounces this rapprochement, described as a hostile act, and is forced to freeze its diplomatic relations with Rabat in 2021. Morocco intends to acquire two Israeli spy satellites. Moroccan strategists seem to have forgotten the Pegasus affair; Israeli spyware which enters the system of the installing party and thus accesses all the data supposedly kept secret. Rabat is just a chip in the big control board. Recently BlueBird confirmed the upcoming opening of a drone manufacturing factory on Moroccan soil. The kingdom is not offended by clearly displaying its intentions to become an arms dealer, even if it means making a pact with the devil, Israel. It hopes to rise among the ranks of arms exporting countries and occupy a place of choice. This all-consuming ambition worries Spain, which it considers a threat and is wary of the hegemonist aims of the new Morocco. Ceuta and Melilla balance between a former colonial power and an emerging Morocco. It was to Israel that Rabat turned in search of an ally and support to build its civilian nuclear power plant. The great powers are less careful when it comes to the Jewish state; the mention of the name causes trembling in certain capitals. Joe Biden, by signing the law on the defense budget for the year 2024, closely linked American military support to Morocco (p.299-300) to its respect for the Abraham Accords. According to the Abraham Accords Peace Institute, the volume of trade between Rabat and Tel Aviv records a clear increase each year. For the year 2023 alone, it reached $116 million. The opening of new airlines has boosted trade. A large Jewish community still lives in Morocco and those who left the kingdom have always kept their ties to the motherland.", "art_category": "politics", "inactive": false, "country_code": "TN", "scrapped_by": "kapitalis.bot", "art_source": "https://kapitalis.com/tunisie/", "art_creation_date": "2024-05-12 14:57:13.015281"}, {"art_url": "https://kapitalis.com/tunisie/2024/05/10/une-societe-de-securite-privee-americaine-gerera-le-poste-frontiere-de-rafah/", "art_title": "une société de sécurité privée américaine gérera le poste-frontière de rafah", "art_published_at": "2024-05-10 00:00:00", "art_content": "The Israeli newspaper Haaretz revealed that an American private security company will take over management of the Rafah border crossing after the end of the Israeli military operation in the town located on the border with Egypt. The White House blandly claims to know nothing about the matter. Strange though! Imed Bahri The Israeli army which invaded parts of Rafah took control of the border post on the Palestinian side since Tuesday morning, May 7, a post which constitutes the main route of delivery of humanitarian aid for the Gaza Strip , which led to its closure in both directions. The Israelis also removed Palestinian flags and raised their own, as photos circulating on social media showed. Haaretza reported that Israel had assured the United States and Egypt that the Rafah operation would be limited, emphasizing that its sole objective was to ensure that Hamas would no longer control the crossing. The newspaper also claims that Israel had committed not to destroy border facilities in order to ensure their continued operation. Obviously, as usual, Israeli officials are lying and manipulating because getting their hands on the Rafah border crossing is not their only goal. They do not stop bombing and massacring civilian populations well after taking possession of the border post. They continue their genocide under the noses of the entire world with a very heavy daily human toll. Haaretz explains that the Israeli takeover of the Rafah border crossing would constitute a decline for Hamas, which would no longer be able to impose taxes on imported goods. The Israeli newspaper reports that \"the members of the American security company which will manage the border crossing are former soldiers of special units of the American army\" and that \"the company which will manage the crossing specializes in guarding strategic sites in conflict zones in Africa. The American company would be entrusted with the task of managing crossing movements, inspecting trucks and preventing Hamas from returning to the site. For his part, the spokesperson for the National Security Council of the United States, John Kirby, declared that he knew nothing about this question. Is he telling the truth or pretending not to know? Mystery and gumdrop. The geopolitical events occurring in Gaza and elsewhere have taught us to always take official American words with caution, especially when they come from the mouth of the very pro-Israeli John Kirby, because how can the American authorities and their intelligence not be aware that a American company was going to manage the Rafah border post and how is it possible that such a sensitive thing could take place without their approval? No private security company in the world can carry out a mission abroad without the authorization of the authorities of its country. The string is a little big, especially since Kirby can play the one who knows nothing to drown out the fish so as not to open the door to controversy. At the same time, this Israeli offensive on Rafah and the takeover of the border crossing is taking over in Israel itself. In Haaretz also, journalist Uri Misgav called on Israelis to be aware of the danger of the “crazy war” that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been waging in the Gaza Strip since October 2023. In his article, Misgav called on Israeli officials to stop manipulate their citizens and raised a number of questions. He asked: \"If Rafah is truly the key to our survival, why didn't we attack it sooner?\" Misgav continued: \"If we (the Israelis, Editor's note) could not guarantee the security of Western Negev without controlling the Rafah crossing, so why did the army wait until this week to seize it? He added that if it was clear from the start to the Netanyahu government that residents of the Gaza border area would not be able to return home without destroying the four brigades of the Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas in Rafah, why did Didn't he attack this city before? Uri Misgav called the war raging in the Gaza Strip “horrible and criminal,” adding that Chief of Staff Herzl Halevy is no less involved than Netanyahu in insisting on its continuation, stressing that his duty to soldiers and Israelis is not limited to implementing orders but rather telling political leaders “Enough!” The simple truth, Misgav analyzes, is that entry into Rafah only became an urgent issue after an agreement was reached with Hamas regarding the exchange of detainees. He says Netanyahu's goal is to thwart any agreement that would result in a ceasefire, and perhaps an end to the war, emphasizing that everyone sees and understands it but Netanyahu continues his chatter.", "art_category": "politics", "inactive": false, "country_code": "TN", "scrapped_by": "kapitalis.bot", "art_source": "https://kapitalis.com/tunisie/", "art_creation_date": "2024-05-12 14:57:14.429676"}, {"art_url": "https://kapitalis.com/tunisie/2024/05/10/la-justice-internationale-en-grand-danger/", "art_title": "la justice internationale en grand danger", "art_published_at": "2024-05-10 00:00:00", "art_content": "The United States, which twice saved the world and helped build international laws and a UN to ensure its primacy, cannot itself be the gravediggers of its own values.

Mehdi Mabrouk* Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni recently made her fourth visit to Tunisia in a year, in addition to dozens of other visits by ministers of her government, including the ministers of Foreign Affairs and the Interior, as well as as the Ministers of Higher Education and Employment. The visit lasted a few hours, after which Meloni flew to Brussels to attend an important meeting at the European Commission. There must be a strong relationship between the two visits, because Meloni insisted that her visit to Tunis be made a few hours before the European meeting, and it is likely that she conveyed [to her European colleagues] the Tunisian position specifically on the issue of immigration, especially since the European Union (EU) has just modified the Pact on Migration and Asylum. Meloni is the heir to a populist political tradition, since she is part of the legacy of Benito Mussolini, who manipulated the emotions of the Italian people and led them to odious fascism. Meloni continued to play on the strings of populism until he convinced an Italian public opinion that was resentful and revolted against the policies of its former leaders, especially since it has not forgotten the tragedy of Covid-19, during which Italy found itself among the European countries most affected by the pandemic. His party, Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), won the elections and the immigration card was one of the levers that propelled it above its competitors. Given the decline of the Socialists, and even the Christian Democrats, the Italian political scene has remained almost empty, with only right-wing movements still playing a role. Meloni repeatedly clashed with her European counterparts, particularly French, when she accused them of being behind the migration of Africans, reminding them, more than once, that France had stripped the countries on the continent of their resources, had impoverished them and supported corrupt regimes that were loyal to it. The French responded to these statements, reminding Meloni that Italy had also colonized African countries [Libya, Ethiopia]. Meloni's clashes with his European counterparts did not end there; it has in fact imposed an amendment to the European Pact on Migration and Asylum, promulgated a few days ago, calling for more European solidarity with the “front line” countries (Italy, Malta, Greece and Spain) where Thousands of migrants live before trying to move to other places. Meloni believes that Italy is a favorite destination for immigrants and, therefore, it has been left alone to bear the brunt of migrants. She is well aware that, to tighten her grip on the immigrants who flock to her country, she needs a partner from outside the European continent, and she believes, with her political intuition and her intelligence, that Tunisia, for many reasons, is a candidate to be a privileged partner in what it calls“the fight against illegal immigration”. Meloni has many arguments to support his thesis, including the fact that Tunisia is governed by a populist regime that has deliberately established a new constitution (2022) that goes far in glorifying the people who must be pure and unadulterated . It is therefore easy to think that migratory waves threaten one's identity. Statements by President Kaïs Saïed in February 2022 considered the migration of Africans from sub-Saharan countries as a plot aimed at changing the identity of the country, through the settlement of a large number of Africans. This adds to the serious economic crisis that has hit the country for many years. All this is happening against the backdrop of the refusal of the IMF, as well as other international donor organizations, to continue helping Tunisia, which categorically rejects their conditions. The Tunisian president believes that these emanate from the recommendations of a global financial system which does not respect the sovereignty of the country and wants to lead it towards more dependence. These declarations, in addition to strict security practices and expulsion campaigns, prompted Italy to propose a project of close cooperation with Tunisia to stop the flow of migrants from our country. Statistics prove that Tunisia is almost the most important crossing point used by African migrants [departing for Italy]. Italy has provided logistical assistance to Tunisian maritime security forces to increase their readiness and capabilities to monitor more than 1,500 kilometers of coastline. He also negotiated with the EU to request financial support that Tunisia considered insufficient, and wanted to exert more pressure so that the funds were up to the “role” played by Tunisia since 2019, the date of accession. from Saïed to the supreme office. In less than a year, Tunisia has been extremely effective in fulfilling its promises to its Italian partner, reducing the number of migrants arriving on Italian shores, expelling thousands of migrants and transferring thousands of migrants. others towards its borders in difficult humanitarian situations. To reward these efforts, Italy has expressed its willingness to legally welcome around 12,000 Tunisian immigrants to work in construction, agriculture and other sectors. An agreement has been drawn up to this effect to be implemented over the coming months, and the recent visit was an opportunity to examine this issue, as well as funding aid for the education, higher education and employment. The flow of migrants arriving in Italy has decreased considerably but, against all expectations, it seems that the number of migrants arriving in Tunisia in recent months has increased in an unprecedented way, meaning that the country could turn into a a trap. for migrants, those who enter finding it impossible to leave. This would only double the burden of their care in terms of residence, employment, supervision, etc. Tunisia has declared itself ready for strong cooperation with Italy to fight against migration, but it still rejects all the proposals put forward by European countries to make it a basis for managing migratory flows, like this what Rwanda did, for example, with Great Britain, when it welcomed thousands of refugees. Britain recently announced that Tunisia had resisted efforts to persuade it to follow Rwanda's example. Translated from Arabic.

What is at stake in the war against Gaza goes well beyond the narrow framework of this small territory which is experiencing one of the most destructive wars of contemporary times, a war for which the International Court of Justice has highlighted “the genocidal risk”. If it first condenses the century-old ordeal of the Palestinian people, the issue goes beyond its borders, with the risks of a regional conflagration and especially with the deepening of the divide between the rest of the world and the West. The latter, mobilized alongside Israel, adopts a Manichean vision of History as a constantly recurring confrontation between Barbarians and Civilized people.

The letter ends with a chilling “You have been warned”. Methods of dirty tricks from the depths that make people jump within the Senate itself. By Imed Bahri The online media Zeteor recently launched in the United States by the Anglo-American journalist Mehdi Hassan revealed, Monday May 6, 2024, that a letter was sent by twelve American Republican senators to the Attorney General of the ICC Karim Khan and that this -it went beyond a warning to become a threatening letter. They threatened him with heavy sanctions if he issued arrest warrants against Israeli leaders and military commanders. The text of the letter obtained by the site indicating that it was sent on April 24 states: \"If the International Criminal Court issues an arrest warrant against Netanyahu and other Israeli officials, this measure will be considered a non-threatening threat. only to the sovereignty of Israel but also to the sovereignty of the United States of America which will result in heavy sanctions.” In their letter, the senators threatened Attorney General Khan, saying, \"If you target Israel, we will target you.\" They also threatened to impose sanctions on employees who work with Mr. Khan and also to ban the prosecutor and his family from entering the United States. The twelve senators concluded their letter with this: “You have been warned!”, a sentence which caused a lot of reaction in the press and on social networks. In a statement to Zeteo, Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland said: \"It is fine to express opposition to possible legal proceedings but it is absolutely wrong to intervene in a legal matter by threatening judges. , their family members, loved ones and employees with retaliation. This brutality is something that suits the mafia, not American senators.” Among the senators who signed the letter is the leader of the Republicans in the Senate, and not the least, Mitch McConnell. The latter appeared in front of the cameras during a press conference last July unable to speak for a few moments before his entourage took him out of the room. The incident sparked speculation about the health of the Republican senator from Kentucky. Last March, McConnell was taken to the hospital after collapsing at a Washington-area hotel. Also among the signatories are faces known for their support of Israel such as Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and South Carolina's Tim Scott, who is reportedly on Donald Trump's shortlist for the vice presidency. Last Friday, the ICC prosecutor's office called for an end to what it called intimidation of judicial officials saying such threats could constitute a crime against the ICC. The office said in a statement published on X that all attempts to obstruct, intimidate or inappropriately influence employees must stop immediately. He added that the Rome Statute which defines the structure of the Court and its areas of jurisdiction prohibits such actions. What is striking, beyond the methods of charade, which constitutes this scandalous letter, is the sentence \"this measure will be considered as a threat not only to the sovereignty of Israel but also to the sovereignty of the United States of 'America'. American senators therefore consider that arrest warrants against Israeli officials constitute a threat to American sovereignty. Why is that? Do Americans have questionable things to reproach themselves for? Why does the work of the ICC bother them so much? This cannot be explained solely by the excess of zeal in the defense of Israel because it is a question of “threat to the sovereignty of the United States of America” and not the least! There, information from the deceased Aaron Bushnell comes to mind. The young soldier, who worked in American Air Force intelligence and who had access to confidential documents, had told his friend just hours before setting himself on fire that American soldiers were fighting in Gaza alongside Israeli soldiers. Do American senators fear that ICC investigators will succeed in revealing compromising truths and pointing the finger at American responsibility? Furthermore, the United States delivered the planes and bombs with which Israel has carried out its genocide and war crimes in Gaza for more than seven months. The responsibility and complicity of the United States are therefore not that difficult to establish. Another element, senior American officials in the Biden administration have not condemned the senators' methods of manipulation. Therefore, the personal threats against Mr. Khan and his family aim to protect Benjamin Netanyahu and his clique of genocidaires from possible international arrest warrants but also to protect the United States whose complicity in genocide and war crimes in Gaza no longer needs to be proven.

The confinement decreed following the unfortunate pandemic, a large number of his faithful friends in Sousse were waiting for the one who was for many years the Mayor of the city and the President of Etoile Sportive du Sahel Sunday March 29, 2020, according to the maid.

However, considering the dramatic situation experienced by the Tunisian people and the entire world due to the pandemic, the family of the deceased. had to postpone this ceremony in order to spare possible risks for those who would have come to share this mourning with her, her relatives and her friends and it was only a few months later that a majestic ceremony was organized in the presence of a large many of his friends. As for me, I lost my brother-in-law, my friend and my confidant. I knew Si Hamed almost 55 years ago and, since then, a sincere, flawless friendship has united us without being burdensome for the statesman that he was. Only family meetings brought us together or even hunting trips: Not being a hunter myself, I was there only to share with the hunters the good lunches and the product of the day's hunt. If Hamed was a pioneer of the national liberation struggle. From a young age, he began to campaign in the ranks of Tunisian scouts and sold posters with Bourguiba's portrait for the benefit of the fund of his Destourian cell in Sousse. In France, where he studied medicine, he founded and chaired the first Destourian cell. He was Bourguiba's frequent visitor during his exile on the island of Groix and led an awareness campaign for the independence of Tunisia in France and in all French cities. Returning to the country, he set up as a doctor fighting tuberculosis while presiding over the municipality of Sousse and Etoile Sportive du Sahel. After a long career in the mazes of the State: Minister of Youth and Sports, Minister of Justice and Prime Minister for around ten years, he was vice-president of the Party before giving way to Mohamed Ghanouchi . His passage everywhere was without pitfalls, as he was so respectful of administrative and political ethics. Politics is nothing without moral values, he said. After 2011, I witnessed all the sadness felt by him to see most of the Destourians, who had built the institutions of the State, intimidated and the base of the Destourians shrinking, or even withdrawing from the political scene hence his famous appeal to the Destourians: “Lift your heads”. Honesty, kindness, rigor, discipline, humility, punctuality, altruism, respect for others and many other human qualities were part of Si Hamed's credo. Mohamed Ghanouchi, who succeeded him as Prime Minister, notably wrote about him: “History will remember the leading role that if Hamed had assumed as Prime Minister throughout the 1990s. I am a witness to it. He was the big brother from whom ministers of all persuasions found advice and help to recharge their batteries and carry out their tasks successfully. History will also remember the eminent role he played in January 2011 in contributing decisively to the continuity of the State. » Tijani Haddad", "art_category": "politics", "inactive": false, "country_code": "TN", "scrapped_by": "jawharafm.bot", "art_source": "https://www.jawharafm.net/fr/", "art_creation_date": "2024-05-12 14:57:34.048913"}, {"art_url": "https://www.jawharafm.net/fr/article/dhaker-lahidheb-la-rupture-des-relations-avec-la-syrie-est-une-grave-erreur/92/85055", "art_title": "dhaker lahidheb : la rupture des relations avec la syrie est une grave erreur", "art_published_at": "2023-04-26 10:36:00", "art_content": "Social media activist and Democratic Current party member Dr. Dhaker Lahidheb considered the severance of relations with Syria to be a serious mistake that constitutes a crime against the Syrian people.

In the National Salvation Front, Johar bin Mubarak, on his hunger strike, insisted on his right to be released and to release all detainees in what is known as the “conspiracy case,” according to the end of the detention period estimated at 14 months, according to the movement’s confirmation. The movement also saluted all the detainees who were on strike in solidarity with the “fighter” Johar bin Mubarak and in adhering to their release. We also salute the families of the detainees and record with great respect their steadfastness and sacrifices. While holding the authority responsible for the danger that could result from the brutal strike to his health and life, as long as it insists on not responding to his demands and the demands of the rest of the detainees, according to its assertion. 2 - The movement renewed its demand to close the file of what it called “political arrests,” take the initiative to release detainees, prepare the country to receive the presidential elections in 2024, and enable Tunisian men and women to express their free will in free, fair and transparent democratic elections. 3 - The movement affirms that the country is in dire and urgent need of changing policies, peaceful transfer of responsibilities, competing programmes, presenting alternatives, and purifying the climate and morals of political life. 4- Appreciating and saluting the involvement of Tunisian students in various universities in the global student movement supporting the right of the Palestinian people and calling for stopping the war, lifting the siege on the Gaza Strip, accelerating the end of the occupation, and recognizing the State of Palestine with its capital, Jerusalem, and the sovereignty of the Palestinian people over its land and wealth.

Yesterday evening, Wednesday, the Eighth Ward Chamber of the Court of First Instance in Tunisia sentenced Mohamed Boughlab to 6 months in prison, on charges of insulting others via social media sites and attributing illegal matters to a public employee, in the file of the complaint filed against him by an employee at the Ministry of Religious Affairs. The court began examining this case on April 3, and decided to postpone consideration of it until yesterday, Wednesday. It also decided to reject the request for Boughlab’s release.

The party considered that the refusal to receive the correspondence constituted a serious legal violation - according to its assessment - by the Elections Authority, so the defense body records the following points: First: It condemns the deprivation of the colleague - in reference to Abeer Moussa - of her constitutional right to access public facilities and enjoy administrative services. Like all citizens, it remembers that Chapter 19 of the 2022 Constitution stipulates that the administration’s departure from its neutrality constitutes a punishable crime. Secondly, it denounces the continued “assault” on the fundamental rights of its colleague, who is currently subject to “forced detention” as a result of “arbitrariness.” ' Which was carried out by those responsible for the Registration Office of the Presidency of the Republic and their refusal to accept the administrative grievances that she submitted against the presidential orders related to the local elections. It considers that spreading this abuse to the various Registration Offices in the interests of the public administration represents a systematic policy to isolate the colleague and treat her as a second-class citizen. Third: The Tunisian people and the national and international electoral oversight bodies bear witness to the Election Commission’s persistence in deviating from its legally imposed duty of impartiality and siding with the authorities against a fellow candidate for the elections and a serious competitor to the one currently in power, and it reserves its right to prosecute those responsible for the transgression committed by those in charge of the Registry Office.
